      <li>4-6 cups hot cooked White Rice (1 cup per serving)</li>
      <li>toasted Sesame Seeds (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the following, placing each ingredient into a separate pile on a baking 
        sheet as you complete it: Trim the stems from 1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms 
        and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (about 6 cups); peel and cut 3 medium carrots 
        into matchsticks (about 2 cups); cut 3 Korean or zucchini squash into matchsticks 
        (about 3 cups); peel and cut 1 pound Korean or daikon radish crosswise into thin 
        rounds, then stack them together and cut into matchsticks (about 4 cups).</li>
      <li>Bring a large saucepan filled three-quarters full with water to a boil over 
        medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1 pound spinach in 2 
        batches. Cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the spinach. When cool enough to handle, grab handfuls of the spinach, 
        squeeze out as much water as possible, and place in a small bowl. Finely grate 
        1 of the garlic cloves on a Microplane onto the spinach. Season with 1/2 
        teaspoon of the kosher salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the toasted 
        sesame oil. Mix with your hands until combined.</li>
      <li>Fill the now-empty saucepan three-quarters full with water and bring to a 
        boil over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 12 ounces 
        soybean sprouts. Cover and simmer, reducing the heat as needed, for 20 minutes. 
        Meanwhile, cook the remaining vegetables.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in a large nonstick frying pan or cast 
        iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the carrots and 1/2 
        teaspoon of the kosher salt. Stir-fry until brighter in color and crisp-tender, 
        2 to 3 minutes. Return to the baking sheet. Wipe out the pan with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in the same pan over medium-high heat until 
        shimmering. Add the squash and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Stir-fry until 
        crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Return to the baking sheet. Wipe out the pan with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in the same pan over high heat until shimmering. 
        Add the mushrooms, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of the toasted sesame oil. 
        Finely grate 1 of the garlic cloves over the mushrooms. Stir-fry until the mushrooms 
        are charred in spots, 4 to 5 minutes. Return to the baking sheet. Wipe out the pan with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
        Add the radish, 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt, and 1/3 cup water. Cook, 
        stirring occasionally, until the radish is translucent and tender but not 
        browned, 8 to 10 minutes. When the radish is almost ready, add 1 tablespoon 
        of the toasted sesame oil and stir-fry for 1 minute more. Return to the 
        baking sheet and reserve the frying pan.
      </li>
      <li>When the soybean sprouts are ready, drain and transfer to a medium bowl. 
        Finely grate the remaining garlic clove over the sprouts. Season with the 
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the 
        toasted sesame oil. Mix with your hands until combined.</li>
      <li>Place 3 tablespoons of gochujang, the remaining 2 tablespoons toasted 
        sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mirin, and 1 tablespoon honey in a small bowl 
        and whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>Wipe out the reserved frying pan with a paper towel. Heat the remaining 
        1 tablespoon neutral oil in the pan over medium heat until shimmering. 
        Swirl the pan to coat the bottom with the oil. Crack 4 to 6 large eggs 
        into the pan, spacing them evenly apart. Reduce the heat to low. Cover 
        and cook undisturbed until the whites are set and the yolks are still 
        runny, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes.</li>
      <li>While the eggs are cooking, start to assemble the bibimbap. For each 
        serving, place 1 cup hot cooked rice in a bowl. Divide and arrange the 
        spinach, mushrooms, carrots, squash, sprouts, and radish in separate piles on the rice.</li>
      <li>Top each bowl with a fried egg and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. 
        Drizzle each bowl with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the gochujang sauce and 
        serve any remaining sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
